Database Columns ------------------------
 - ID will be used to display an entries ID, this is good for finding or editing an entry
 - Display is used to display whether an entry is still actively promoting music
 - Name is obviously the name of the entry (i.e. PhaseBeats)
 - Sub is to show the submission of an entry. PHP will take care of submission type so links, email addresses, or soundcloud all work well
 - Genres will be edited in the normal edit menu for a promoter, you'll be presented with multiple checkboxes
 - Facebook
 - Soundcloud
 - Youtube
 - Instagram
 - Twitter
 - Webpage
 - Meta-data


FLAGGING SYSTEM ------------------------
The flag system is going to be used for easily accessing user submitted entries and approving or declining them.
This could possibly be done just by inserting a JS Object into the database, but that'll require some further testing.
The flag data will be stored in a separate database table, as to keep the main database table fast and responsive.

All of this will be accessed in a separate page, rather than a modal as previously planned.

FLAG TYPES:
pending  - This means a user has submitted this entry and it is awaiting approval
delete   - This means an entry has been marked for removal, this must be viewed by an admin for approval
edit     - This means a user has requested an edit to an entry. They will be able to provide their reason in a text-input


META-DATA ------------------------
Meta-data will allow the keeping of basic data, such as whom added the entry, when it was entered, when it was last edited, when it was last scanned, etc etc.
This could (hopefully) be stored as a JSON object just as well.

NOTE: Testing with JSON data in an SQL column went well, will test a bit further before implementation.



USER ACCOUNT TYPES ------------------------
Administrator --
Administrators have the permission to do anything they please, only one will exist that will be myself.
This includes adding active entries immediately without approval, creating backups of the database, approving user submitted entries, editing entries, deleting entries, scan the entire database, as well as much more.

Moderator --
A moderator has most of abilities an administrator would have, minus a few things. A moderator would not be handling the deletion of database backups though they can make a backup (limited to one per day), moderators may add and edit entries, but may not delete an entry.

User --
A user is very limited, as they may only add an entry that must be approved. They may also request an edit or deletion, this will be a separate flag type however.

Accounts will also have to have the ability to be flagged, in case of spamming or things of the sort
